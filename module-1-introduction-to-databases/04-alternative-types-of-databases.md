## Comparison: Relational vs NoSQL

| Feature | Relational Databases | NoSQL Databases |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Data Structure** | Structured (tables) | Flexible (various formats) |
| **Schema** | Fixed schema | Dynamic schema |
| **Scalability** | Vertical (add power) | Horizontal (add servers) |
| **Best For** | Structured data | Unstructured/semi-structured |
| **Examples** | MySQL, PostgreSQL | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis |

## Data Types

### Structured Data
