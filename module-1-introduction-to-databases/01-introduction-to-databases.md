# Introduction to Databases

## Overview

Almost everyone has used a database, and information about us is probably present in many databases all over the world. Understanding what a database is and how important databases are to global industry, government, and organizations is fundamental for any developer.

## What is a Database?

A **database** is a form of electronic storage in which data is held.

This straightforward description doesn't fully explain the impact of database technology on our modern world.

## Real-World Database Use Cases

### Banking
Banks use databases to store:
- Customer data
- Bank accounts
- Transactions

### Healthcare
Hospitals store:
- Patient data
- Staff data
- Laboratory data
- Medical records

### E-Commerce
Online stores retain:
- Your profile information
- Shopping history
- Accounting transactions

### Additional Data Collection

Many services have access to diverse data:
- Your location
- Time spent on their platform
- Friends you're connected with
- Many more facts about your behavior

## The Big Data Revolution

### Sources of Massive Data

**Online Services:**
- Generate enormous amounts of data
- Large user base
- Constant user activity

**Social Media Platforms:**
- Billions of users worldwide
- Continuous interactions
- User-generated content

**Internet of Things (IoT):**
- Many devices connected to the internet
- Continual streams of data
- Sensors and smart devices

### The Result: Big Data

These continual streams have led to a **revolution in database technology** to accommodate:

- **Volume:** Massive amounts of data
- **Variety:** Different types of data
- **Complexity:** Intricate relationships and structures

This has become known as **big data**.

## Core Database Actions

Whatever the source of data, a database will typically carry out these actions (developers must be familiar with all of them):

### 1. Store the Data
Securely save information in an organized manner

### 2. Form Connections
Create relationships between segmented areas of data

### 3. Filter the Data
Show relevant records based on criteria

### 4. Search Data
Return matching records based on queries

### 5. Perform Functions
Allow data to be:
- Updated
- Changed
- Deleted
as required
