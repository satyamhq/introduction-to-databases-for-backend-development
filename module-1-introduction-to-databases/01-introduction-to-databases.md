# Introduction to Databases

## What is a Database?

A database is a form of electronic storage in which data is held. Almost everyone has used a database, and information about us is probably present in many databases all over the world. Databases are critical to global industry, government, and organizations.

## Real-World Use Cases

Databases are used everywhere in the modern world:

- **Banks**: Store data for customers, bank accounts, and transactions
- **Hospitals**: Store patient data, staff data, laboratory data, and more
- **Online Stores**: Retain profile information, shopping history, and accounting transactions

Many services collect and store diverse data beyond just basic information:

- Your location
- How long you spend on their platform
- Friends you connected with
- And many more facts

## Big Data Revolution

Online services and social media platforms generate enormous amounts of data due to their large user base and constant user activity. With the Internet of Things (IoT), many devices are now connected to the internet. These continual streams of data have led to a revolution in database technology to accommodate the volume, variety, and complexity of what has become known as **big data**.

## Core Database Operations

Whatever the source of the data, a database will typically carry out the following actions:

- **Store** the data
- **Form connections or relationships** between segmented areas of the data
- **Filter** the data to show relevant records
- **Search** data to return matching records
- **Update, change, and delete** data as required

These operations form the foundation of database management and are essential skills for back-end developers.
