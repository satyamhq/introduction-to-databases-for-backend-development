## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this course. Almost everyone has used a database, and more likely, information about us is probably present in many databases all over the world. But who truly understands what a database is and how important databases are to global industry, government, and organizations?

A very straightforward description of a database is that it is a form of electronic storage in which data is held. Of course, that explanation does not even come close to explaining the impact of database technology.

## Real-World Use Cases

To give an idea of databases in a real-world context, let's briefly describe some typical use cases:

- **Banking**: Your bank uses a database to store data for customers, bank accounts, and transactions
- **Healthcare**: Hospitals store patient data, staff data, laboratory data, and more
- **E-commerce**: Online stores retain your profile information along with your shopping history and accounting transactions

Many of these services have access to a diverse range of data they collect and store, including:

- Your location
- How long you spend on their platform
- Friends you connected with
- Many more facts

## Big Data Revolution

Such online services and social media platforms generate enormous amounts of data due to their large user base and constant user activity. With the Internet of Things (IoT), many extra devices are now connected to the internet. These continual streams of data have led to a revolution in database technology to accommodate the volume, variety, and complexity of what has become known as **big data**.

## Core Database Operations

Whatever the source of the data, a database will typically carry out the following actions, all of which developers such as yourself must be familiar with:

- **Store** the data
- **Form connections or relationships** between segmented areas of the data
- **Filter** the data to show relevant records
- **Search** data to return matching records
- **Update, change, and delete** data as required

Don't worry if you don't fully understand all these terms for now—you're just receiving a brief introduction to databases and data. During the course, you'll explore these concepts in more detail alongside the many other tasks that form the duties of a back-end developer.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this course, you will learn about:

- The concepts of data and databases
- How data is related in the database
- Different database structures and their uses
- How to perform **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations
- How to use SQL operators to sort and filter data
- What database normalization is and how to normalize a database

You'll also get to build a fully operational database and install and set up software called XAMPP on your computer to help progress your local and remote database learning.

## Course Structure

There are many videos in your course that will gradually guide you towards that goal:

- Watch, pause, rewind, and rewatch the videos until you're confident in your skills
- Consolidate your knowledge by consulting the course readings
- Put your skills into practice during the course exercises

Along the way, you'll encounter several knowledge quizzes where you can self-check your progress. You're not alone in considering a career as a back-end developer, which is why you'll also work with course discussion prompts that enable you to connect with your classmates. It's a great way to share knowledge, discuss difficulties, and make new friends.

## Tips for Success

To be successful in this course, it is helpful to:

- Commit to a regular and disciplined approach to learning
- Be serious about your study
- Map out a study schedule with dates and times that you can devote to attending the course

It's an online self-paced course, but it does help to think of your study in terms of regular attendance at a learning institute.

## Summary

In summary, this course provides you with a complete introduction to databases and is part of a program of courses that lead you towards a career in back-end development.
