# Introduction to Databases

## Overview

Almost everyone has used a database, and information about us is probably present in many databases all over the world. But who truly understands what a database is and how important databases are to global industry, government, and organizations?

## What is a Database?

A database is a form of electronic storage in which data is held. Of course, that explanation does not even come close to explaining the impact of database technology.

## Real-World Use Cases

To give an idea of databases in a real-world context, here are some typical use cases:

- **Banks**: Use databases to store data for customers, bank accounts, and transactions
- **Hospitals**: Store patient data, staff data, laboratory data, and more
- **Online Stores**: Retain your profile information along with your shopping history and accounting transactions

Many of these services have access to a diverse range of data they collect and store, such as:

- Your location
- How long you spend on their platform
- Friends you connected with
- Many more facts

## Big Data Revolution

Online services and social media platforms generate enormous amounts of data due to their large user base and constant user activity. With the Internet of Things (IoT), many extra devices are now connected to the internet. These continual streams of data have led to a revolution in database technology to accommodate the volume, variety, and complexity of what has become known as **big data**.

## Core Database Operations

Whatever the source of the data, a database will typically carry out the following actions:

- **Store** the data
- **Form connections or relationships** between segmented areas of the data
- **Filter** the data to show relevant records
- **Search** data to return matching records
- Allow the data to be **updated, changed, and deleted** as required

All of these operations are essential for developers to understand.
